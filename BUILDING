Building With SCons
===================

- Install the scons build tool for your platform. On Debian based systems, 
  sudo apt-get install scons should be sufficient.

  Win32 systems have a manual installer available to them above.

- Building everything:
    scons -Q [debug=0|1]

  Building a component only (eg. assembler, compiler, etc):
    scons -Q [aa|ac]
